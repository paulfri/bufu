The DualShock was developed by Sony for use with the original PlayStation and released in <a data-ref-id=\\\"3035-37\\\" href=\\\"\\/japan\\/3035-37\\/\\\" slug=\\\"japan\\\">         Japan<\\/a> in 1997. The PlayStation's original controller lacked analog control and force feedback. The 1999 game <a data-ref-id=\\\"3030-13371\\\" href=\\\"\\/ape-escape\\/3030-13371\\/\\\" slug=\\\"ape-escape\\\">            Ape Escape<\\/a> was the first to require a DualShock for play, and Sony quickly adopted the controller as the PlayStation standard, packing it in with subsequent versions of the console.<br\\/><br\\/>The <a data-ref-id=\\\"3045-19\\\" href=\\\"\\/playstation-2\\/3045-19\\/\\\" slug=\\\"playstation-2\\\">        PlayStation 2<\\/a> version of the DualShock was known as the <a data-ref-id=\\\"3000-30\\\" href=\\\"\\/dualshock-2\\/3000-30\\/\\\" slug=\\\"dualshock-2\\\"> DualShock 2<\\/a>. Though its outward design remained the same (other than a shift from grey to black), the controller integrated pressure-sensitive face and shoulder buttons.<br\\/><br\\/>Sony caused a stir prior to the release of the <a data-ref-id=\\\"3045-35\\\" href=\\\"\\/playstation-3\\/3045-35\\/\\\" slug=\\\"playstation-3\\\">      PlayStation 3<\\/a>, first by showing a radically redesigned DualShock that many commentators derisively described as a <a data-ref-id=\\\"3055-76\\\" href=\\\"\\/boomerang\\/3055-76\\/\\\" slug=\\\"boomerang\\\">       boomerang<\\/a>. The new design was either loved or hated by Playstation 3 followers. This design was scrapped before release, however.<br\\/><br\\/>The original PlayStation 3 release saw the replacement of the DualShock with the <a data-ref-id=\\\"3000-9\\\" href=\\\"\\/sixaxis-controller\\/3000-9\\/\\\" slug=\\\"sixaxis-controller\\\">  SIxaxis<\\/a>, an outwardly identical controller that inwardly lacked force feedback due to an ongoing lawsuit over the vibration copyright with hardware company Immersion. Instead, the Sixaxis featured an accelerometer that sensed motion input. Sony finally released a revised version of the SIxaxis that included force feedback support, not surprisingly dubbed the <a data-ref-id=\\\"3000-29\\\" href=\\\"\\/dualshock-3\\/3000-29\\/\\\" slug=\\\"dualshock-3\\\"> DualShock 3<\\/a>, in 2008. The first software to support DualShock 3 technology was a demo of <a data-ref-id=\\\"3030-20597\\\" href=\\\"\\/gran-turismo-5-prologue\\/3030-20597\\/\\\" slug=\\\"gran-turismo-5-prologue\\\"> Gran Turismo 5 Prologue<\\/a> which was released on the Japanese <a data-ref-id=\\\"3045-88\\\" href=\\\"\\/playstation-network-ps3\\/3045-88\\/\\\" slug=\\\"playstation-network-ps3\\\"> PSN <\\/a>Store\\u00a0on October 20, 2007. \\u00a0Initially, the DualShock 3 controller was released in Japan on November 11, 2007 in black only and didn't reach North America until April 5, 2008 and Europe until July 2, 2008 (UK July 4, 2008).

The Power Glove was unique for its time, allowing players to use motion to control their games. While the device delivered imprecise and clumsy controls, it was still considered to be a commercial success at the time, selling a total of around 100,000 units in the United States. However, poor sales of the peripheral and a lack of Power Glove-specific games in Japan forced PAX to declare bankruptcy. The Glove did not live up to most young players' expectations, especially those who had seen <em>The Wizard<\\/em>, a movie starring Fred Savage that glorified <a data-ref-id=\\\"3010-90\\\" href=\\\"\\/nintendo\\/3010-90\\/\\\" slug=\\\"nintendo\\\"> Nintendo<\\/a> and suggested that the Power Glove had serious virtual reality capabilities.

The glove emits sounds (inaudible to humans) that are detected by a unit that wraps around the outside of the television. One problem is that the detection system\\u2019s \\\"microphones\\\" are of inferior quality and a significant amount of distortion results. Players found that controlling games with the Power Glove was universally more difficult than with the standard <a data-ref-id=\\\"3045-21\\\" href=\\\"\\/nes\\/3045-21\\/\\\" slug=\\\"nes\\\"> NES<\\/a> controller. Another problem is that Nintendo\\u2019s original Entertainment System is not technologically sophisticated enough to handle the three-dimensional environments that could truly take advantage of a device like the Power Glove, despite Mattel's intriguing attempt with <a data-ref-id=\\\"3030-13107\\\" href=\\\"\\/super-glove-ball\\/3030-13107\\/\\\" slug=\\\"super-glove-ball\\\"> <em>Super Glove Ball<\\/em><\\/a>, a type of handball simulation that was one of only two games made to specifically utilize the Glove's features, the other being a forgettable fighting game called <a data-ref-id=\\\"3030-13315\\\" href=\\\"\\/bad-street-brawler\\/3030-13315\\/\\\" slug=\\\"bad-street-brawler\\\"> <i>Bad Street Brawler<\\/i><\\/a>.
