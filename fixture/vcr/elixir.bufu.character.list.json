He became a <a href=\\\"\\/ninja\\/3015-12\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3015-12\\\">ninja<\\/a> to provide a better life for his wife and son against the wishes of his father, himself already a member of the Shirai. His clan's most hated rivals were the <a href=\\\"\\/lin-kuei\\/3015-5062\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3015-5062\\\">Lin Kuei<\\/a> clan. Scorpion and his mortal enemy <a href=\\\"\\/noob-saibot\\/3005-152\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3005-152\\\">Sub-Zero<\\/a> were both hired by Quan Chi to retrieve a scroll from the <a href=\\\"\\/himalayas\\/3035-3474\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3035-3474\\\">Himalayas<\\/a>, but the two ninjas crossed paths, leading them to fight in the mountains. Sub-Zero emerged the winner, decapitating Scorpion with his ice blade in the process. This scenario played out in <a href=\\\"\\/mortal-kombat-mythologies-sub-zero\\/3030-17295\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-17295\\\"><i>Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero<\\/i><\\/a> in which Scorpion played a <a href=\\\"\\/bosses\\/3015-229\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3015-229\\\">boss<\\/a>. Scorpion soon found himself in the Netherrealm, where he again fought and lost to Sub-Zero later in the same game, presented with a choice: an eternity in hell, or a return to Earth as a spectre with no memories of his past. Scorpion chose revenge, and returned to Earth only to find that Sub-Zero had wiped out the Shirai Ryu clan entirely, including his wife and child.<\\/p><p>He enrolled in the first <a href=\\\"\\/mortal-kombat\\/3030-15743\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-15743\\\">Mortal Kombat<\\/a> tournament as an undead warrior to seek out and kill Sub-Zero at long last. He succeeded in this, but lost the overall tournament. His victory was short-lived when he heard that Sub-Zero had entered the second <a href=\\\"\\/mortal-kombat-ii\\/3030-3571\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-3571\\\">Mortal Kombat<\\/a> tournament and Scorpion followed suit. The wraith tracked down his nemesis but, after seeing him spare the life of an opponent, realized he couldn't be the man who killed him. It was revealed to him that this was actually Sub-Zero's younger brother, taking on his dead brother's identity to restore honour to the title of Sub-Zero in murdering so many unjustly as well as failing to kill <a href=\\\"\\/shang-tsung\\/3005-92\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3005-92\\\">Shang Tsung<\\/a>, the first tournament's host. Scorpion unexpectedly vowed to protect the new Sub-Zero, after recognizing a kinship as he had also abandoned the evil ways of his past.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/3699\\/358644-scorpionkjpg.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-358644\\\" data-size=\\\"small\\\" style=\\\"width: 466px\\\" data-ratio=\\\"1.068669527897\\\" data-width=\\\"466\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:106.9%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/3699\\/358644-scorpionkjpg.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-358644\\\"><img alt=\\\"Scorpion in Deadly Alliance\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/3699\\/358644-scorpionkjpg.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/3699\\/358644-scorpionkjpg.jpg 466w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px\\\" data-width=\\\"598\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>Scorpion in Deadly Alliance<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>In <a href=\\\"\\/ultimate-mortal-kombat-3\\/3030-2178\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-2178\\\">Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"\\/netherrealm\\/3035-615\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3035-615\\\">Netherrealm<\\/a> was invaded by <a href=\\\"\\/shao-kahn\\/3005-91\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3005-91\\\">Shao Kahn,<\\/a> who attacked Earth and recruited Scorpion into his army. The alliance, which COULD be described as deadly, was quickly dissolved when Scorpion learned of young Sub-Zero being on the side of Earth Realm. Scorpion immediately joined Earth's warriors to defeat Shao Kahn's forces but this alliance, too, was short-lived as in <a href=\\\"\\/mortal-kombat-4\\/3030-6421\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-6421\\\">Mortal Kombat 4<\\/a>, Scorpion was tricked into believing that Sub-Zero HAD killed his family by evil sorcerer Quan Chi. Scorpion confronted and defeated Sub-Zero, who denied involvement in his family's death. Quan Chi revealed himself the true killer and cast a spell to return Scorpion to the Netherrealm. Scorpion hurled himself at Quan Chi before the spell fully took affect and transported Quan Chi to the hellish dimension with him.<\\/p><p><a href=\\\"\\/mortal-kombat-deadly-alliance\\/3030-6588\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-6588\\\">Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance<\\/a> found Quan Chi rescued from Netherrealm by the demons <a href=\\\"\\/moloch\\/3005-398\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3005-398\\\">Moloch<\\/a> and <a href=\\\"\\/drahmin\\/3005-382\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3005-382\\\">Drahmin<\\/a>, who then attacked Scorpion. Scorpion tracked Quan Chi while evading the two demons.
