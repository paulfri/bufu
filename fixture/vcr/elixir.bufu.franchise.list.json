The concept of the game was that Mario (then named Jumpman) had to save his girlfriend from his pet gorilla; <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/donkey-kong\\/94-299\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Donkey Kong<\\/a>. The player would walk up slanted floors, climb ladders and avoid barrels on his way to the to save his girlfriend.<\\/p><p>In 1983, Nintendo developed and published Mario's second game, an arcade game titled simply \\\"Mario Brothers.\\\" The game was primarily a competitive two-player focused title, featuring Mario and his brother <a data-ref-id=\\\"3005-370\\\" href=\\\"\\/luigi\\/3005-370\\/\\\" slug=\\\"luigi\\\">Luigi<\\/a>. The object of the game was to kill more enemies (and collect their coins) than the counterpart, while doing everything possible to inconvenience or kill the other player. This was accomplished by stomping on the heads of some enemies, using the <a data-ref-id=\\\"3055-421\\\" href=\\\"\\/pow-block\\/3055-421\\/\\\" slug=\\\"pow-block\\\">POW Block<\\/a> to knock some over so they could be kicked, or jumping into the floor underneith enemies to knock them upside down.

This was one of the first side-scrolling platforming games, and featured Mario and his brother <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/luigi\\/94-370\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Luigi<\\/a> trying to save Princess Peach from <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/bowser\\/94-337\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Bowser<\\/a>. After three levels the player was faced with a castle with Bowser waiting at the end, after the player defeated him he was told that the princess is in another castle, starting a new set of levels.<\\/p><p><a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/super-mario-bros-2\\/61-7406\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Super Mario Bros. 2<\\/a> was released for the NES in 1988. This game was actually a modified version of Doki Doki Panic, an unrelated Japanese platformer that was converted into a Mario game. In this game the player was given a choice to play as Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach and Toad. Each had their own unique way of handling; Luigi had the highest jumps, Peach could glide for several seconds, Toad had the most powerful jump but the least height and distance and Mario was the middle ground. In this game Mario and his friends had to stop a frog named Wart from taking over Dream Land.<\\/p><p><a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/super-mario-bros-3\\/61-10299\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Super Mario Bros. 3<\\/a> was released in the United States in 1990, after being featured in the film \\\"The Wizard.\\\" The game was a return to the \\\"run and jump\\\" mechanics of the first Super Mario Brothers, and required Mario or Luigi to save the Princess and the rulers of 7 kingdoms by obtaining the wands that the Koopa kids had stolen. This game introduced the world map to Mario games, as well as new items like the raccoon tail and the Tanooki suit.<\\/p><p>In his first Game Boy game, <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/super-mario-land\\/61-19834\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Super Mario Land<\\/a>, Mario had to save <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/princess-daisy\\/94-807\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Princess Daisy<\\/a> of Sarasaland from <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/tatanga\\/94-2777\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Tatanga<\\/a>, an alien that had captured her. The gameplay for this game was very similar to the previous installments, but the fire flower was changed to fire superballs, which bounced off walls, ceilings and floors. They could be used to obtain hard to reach items.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/25\\/11448-snes_super_mario_world_1.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-11448\\\" data-size=\\\"small\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.75\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:75.0%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/25\\/11448-snes_super_mario_world_1.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-11448\\\"><img alt=\\\"Super Mario World\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/0\\/25\\/11448-snes_super_mario_world_1.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/25\\/11448-snes_super_mario_world_1.jpg 640w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/25\\/11448-snes_super_mario_world_1.jpg 480w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/0\\/25\\/11448-snes_super_mario_world_1.jpg 320w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\\\" data-width=\\\"320\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>Super Mario World<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>Super Mario Land had a sequel named, <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/super-mario-land-2-6-golden-coins\\/61-14425\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins<\\/a>.

Yoshi could eat enemies and, after eating shells, would gain a new ability. Blue shells allowed him to fly, red shells made him spit fire, and yellow made him land with a damaging puff of smoke.<\\/p><p>In <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/super-mario-world-2-yoshis-island\\/61-2866\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island<\\/a>, Mario took a back seat and let Yoshi take the helm as the game told the beginnings of Mario and Luigi. Kamek, Bowser's sorcerer, foresaw that Mario and Luigi would cause trouble for Bowser in the future, so he tried to kipknap them as the Stork delivered them, but only managed to grab Luigi. Mario fell toward Yoshi's Island where a group of Yoshi's rescued him and set out to save Luigi, returning them both home. The gameplay in Yoshi's Island kept the platforming aspects of Mario games intact, but added a feature that when Yoshi is hit, baby Mario would fly off his back to be reobtained before Kamek could take him. Yoshi was also able to fire eggs at his enemies.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/7\\/70944\\/1229654-super_mario_64_title_screen.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1229654\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.75\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:75.0%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/7\\/70944\\/1229654-super_mario_64_title_screen.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1229654\\\"><img alt=\\\"The title screen for Super Mario 64.\\\" src=\\\"data:image\\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\" class=\\\"js-lazy-load-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/7\\/70944\\/1229654-super_mario_64_title_screen.jpg\\\" data-srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/7\\/70944\\/1229654-super_mario_64_title_screen.jpg 600w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/7\\/70944\\/1229654-super_mario_64_title_screen.jpg 480w\\\"><noscript><img alt=\\\"The title screen for Super Mario 64.\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/7\\/70944\\/1229654-super_mario_64_title_screen.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/7\\/70944\\/1229654-super_mario_64_title_screen.jpg 600w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/7\\/70944\\/1229654-super_mario_64_title_screen.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/noscript><\\/a><figcaption>The title screen for Super Mario 64.<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>Mario's first 3D appearance was in <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/super-mario-64\\/61-2931\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Mario 64<\\/a>.

It was billed as a family comedy. The movie starred Mario (Bob Hoskins) and Luigi (John Leguizamo) in a fight against King Koopa (Dennis Hooper). Instead of Princess Peach, this movie had Princess Daisy (Samantha Mathis). The movie took place in Brooklyn, in a dystopian future. The film involves two dimensions (one of which is ruled by an evolved humanlike race of dinosaurs). King Koopa is trying to merge the two dimensions, while Mario and Luigi fight to stop him. In addition, the film has a romance between Luigi and Princess Daisy. The film was considered to be a major flop (and a terrible movie), with it making only about $21 million, while the budget was around $42 million.

It was the most-played game on Xbox Live for two years, until the release of <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/gears-of-war\\/62-565\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Gears of War<\\/a>, and it held the longest streak as the number one game on the service. The game introduced the playable <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/arbiter\\/94-58\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Arbiter<\\/a> character, and the ability to dual-wield weapons. Halo 2 was later released for Windows Vista by a joint Microsoft and Bungie team called Hired Gun, with a map editor and a few exclusive PC maps, although this port was released too late to have much relevance to the PC gaming scene. Halo 2 made $125 million and sold 2.38 million copies on the first day of its release. After release, Bungie supported Halo 2 with downloadable balance updates and <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/halo-2-multiplayer-map-pack\\/61-10706\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">map packs<\\/a> from Xbox Live.<\\/p><h3>Halo 3<\\/h3><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-size=\\\"small\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-11464\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/25\\/11464-Halo3_Valhalla-3rdperson-01.jpg\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\" data-width=\\\"3840\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" style=\\\"width: 3840px\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/25\\/11464-Halo3_Valhalla-3rdperson-01.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-11464\\\"><img alt=\\\"Halo 3 multiplayer\\\" src=\\\"data:image\\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\\\" data-width=\\\"320\\\" class=\\\"js-lazy-load-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/0\\/25\\/11464-Halo3_Valhalla-3rdperson-01.jpg\\\" data-srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/25\\/11464-Halo3_Valhalla-3rdperson-01.jpg 3840w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/0\\/25\\/11464-Halo3_Valhalla-3rdperson-01.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/25\\/11464-Halo3_Valhalla-3rdperson-01.jpg 480w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/0\\/25\\/11464-Halo3_Valhalla-3rdperson-01.jpg 320w\\\"><noscript><img alt=\\\"Halo 3 multiplayer\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/0\\/25\\/11464-Halo3_Valhalla-3rdperson-01.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/25\\/11464-Halo3_Valhalla-3rdperson-01.jpg 3840w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/0\\/25\\/11464-Halo3_Valhalla-3rdperson-01.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/25\\/11464-Halo3_Valhalla-3rdperson-01.jpg 480w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/0\\/25\\/11464-Halo3_Valhalla-3rdperson-01.jpg 320w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\\\" data-width=\\\"320\\\"><\\/noscript><\\/a><figcaption>Halo 3 multiplayer<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>The final game of the original Halo series was <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/halo-3\\/61-9993\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Halo 3<\\/a>, the first Halo game on the Xbox 360. It was released on September 25, 2007. Accompanied by a huge media blitz and much hype, the game scored quite well with critics, and sold predictably well. Halo 3 added more new weapons and vehicles, as well as the Forge map editor, which allows players to modify and share their own unique levels. The game made $170 million in its first twenty-four hours. Halo 3 was also supported post-release by Bungie, with two title updates as well as a new playlist ranking system, weekend double-XP playlists, and 9 downloadable maps, with 3 more exclusive maps from Halo 3: ODST.<\\/p><h2>Reclaimer Saga<\\/h2><h3>Halo 4<\\/h3><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-size=\\\"small\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2443730\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/8\\/85589\\/2443730-9206456611-23327.jpg\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\" data-width=\\\"1280\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" style=\\\"width: 1280px\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/8\\/85589\\/2443730-9206456611-23327.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2443730\\\"><img alt=\\\"Halo 4 campaign\\\" src=\\\"data:image\\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\\\" data-width=\\\"320\\\" class=\\\"js-lazy-load-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/8\\/85589\\/2443730-9206456611-23327.jpg\\\" data-srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/8\\/85589\\/2443730-9206456611-23327.jpg 1280w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/8\\/85589\\/2443730-9206456611-23327.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/8\\/85589\\/2443730-9206456611-23327.jpg 480w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/8\\/85589\\/2443730-9206456611-23327.jpg 320w\\\"><noscript><img alt=\\\"Halo 4 campaign\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/8\\/85589\\/2443730-9206456611-23327.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/8\\/85589\\/2443730-9206456611-23327.jpg 1280w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/8\\/85589\\/2443730-9206456611-23327.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/8\\/85589\\/2443730-9206456611-23327.jpg 480w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/8\\/85589\\/2443730-9206456611-23327.jpg 320w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\\\" data-width=\\\"320\\\"><\\/noscript><\\/a><figcaption>Halo 4 campaign<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p><a href=\\\"\\/halo-4\\/3030-35533\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-35533\\\">Halo 4<\\/a> is the first game in the \\\"Reclaimer Saga\\\" developed by <a href=\\\"\\/343-industries\\/3010-6753\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3010-6753\\\">343-Industries<\\/a>, and was released on November 6, 2012 worldwide. For this installment, more of an emphasis was placed on developing the relationship between Master Chief and Cortana, the series' two main characters. The game grossed $220 million on its launch day, and as of December 6, 2012, the game's sales totaled an approximate four million copies. This is the first numbered Halo game to not be developed by the series' creator Bungie, instead being created by 343-Industries, a company created by Microsoft to oversee the entire Halo brand.<\\/p><h3>Halo 5: Guardians<\\/h3><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-size=\\\"small\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/8\\/85589\\/2805279-0245756470-27600.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2805279\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\" data-width=\\\"960\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" style=\\\"width: 960px\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/8\\/85589\\/2805279-0245756470-27600.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2805279\\\"><img alt=\\\"Halo 5's Blue Team\\\" src=\\\"data:image\\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\\\" data-width=\\\"320\\\" class=\\\"js-lazy-load-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/8\\/85589\\/2805279-0245756470-27600.jpg\\\" data-srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/8\\/85589\\/2805279-0245756470-27600.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/8\\/85589\\/2805279-0245756470-27600.jpg 480w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/8\\/85589\\/2805279-0245756470-27600.jpg 320w\\\"><noscript><img alt=\\\"Halo 5's Blue Team\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/8\\/85589\\/2805279-0245756470-27600.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/8\\/85589\\/2805279-0245756470-27600.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/8\\/85589\\/2805279-0245756470-27600.jpg 480w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/8\\/85589\\/2805279-0245756470-27600.jpg 320w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\\\" data-width=\\\"320\\\"><\\/noscript><\\/a><figcaption>Halo 5's Blue Team<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p><a href=\\\"\\/halo-5-guardians\\/3030-42905\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-42905\\\">Halo 5: Guardians<\\/a> was released October 27, 2015, and features a split single-player campaign featuring series mainstay Master Chief, as well as new character Spartan <a href=\\\"\\/jameson-locke\\/3005-29903\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3005-29903\\\">Jameson Locke<\\/a>. The story sees Locke's Osiris Squad hunting down Master Chief and his group of old teammates, Blue Team. The game features several new multiplayer modes, the most significant being Warzone, which ups the typical 16-player limit found in the Big Team Battle mode from past games to 24. It also differs in that Covenant and Promethean enemies are added to the match to provide secondary objectives.<\\/p><p>One of the notable changes for Halo 5: Guardians is that it's the first Halo title to release with 60 frames per second gameplay.

The game dispenses with Master Chief as the main character and instead focuses on a brand new character; a silent <a href=\\\"\\/odst\\/3015-641\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3015-641\\\">ODST<\\/a> soldier known as \\\"The Rookie\\\" . After an incident which causes The Rookie to be separated from the rest of his squad, he awakes 6 hours after dropping into the city, alone. A large part of the game is spent exploring the city, trying to piece together the fate of his squad. While no longer in control of a spartan, the gameplay is still very similar to that of previous Halo games. The player is able to use all of the previous weapons with the only change of no longer being able to dual wield. Also while the traditional shield mechanic is now replaced by a stamina system, the two function in a similar manner. Despite the name, the events in the game actually occur during the time of Halo 2.<\\/p><h3>Halo: Spartan Assault<\\/h3><p><a href=\\\"\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/halo-spartan-assault\\/3030-42843\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-42843\\\">Halo: Spartan Assault<\\/a> was developed by <a href=\\\"\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/vanguard-games\\/3010-7327\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3010-7327\\\">Vanguard Games<\\/a> and 343 Industries Itt is a top down, \\\"twin stick\\\" shooter following the character <a href=\\\"\\/sarah-palmer\\/3005-24205\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3005-24205\\\">Sarah Palmer<\\/a>, introduced in Halo 4.

The novel portrays a younger and newly promoted <i>Captain Jacob Keyes<\\/i> and a <i>Dr. Catherine Halsey<\\/i> on a mission to find subjects for the Spartan - II super soldier program.<\\/p><p>While weeding through potential candidates, Halsey finds herself on Eridanus - II, watching a freckled face boy dominate his fellow elementary school classmates in a game of King of the Hill. As it turns out, this boy, <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/master-chief\\/94-175\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">John<\\/a>, was exactly who she came to see. Halsey approaches the boy and proposes they play a game. She would flip a coin and if John could tell her which side it would land on before it hits the ground, the coin would be his. This was actually a test for the boy because it is the belief of Dr. Halsey that there is a great deal of luck involved in the outcome of a battle. As there are too many Spartan candidates as it is, she would use this test to weed out the \\\"lucky few\\\" who would enter into the program.<\\/p><p>To her amazement, not only is John correct about the side on which the coin would land, but as the coin is spinning, he observes and calculates exactly which side it would be. With that John wins the coin and is later taken from his home, enrolled in the Spartan - II program, and replaced with an identical (although flawed clone) would continue to live as John for a short time before an \\\"accidental\\\" death.<\\/p><p>John finds himself in a military base on Reach, the planet-made-headquarters of the USFN, the main military force of earth. Here, he meets the group of over 100 others chosen as the best of the best of humanity's children and destined to become their greatest asset. He is given the codename Spartan 117, being the 17th of the 2nd group of Spartans (after the failure of the first Spartan program). The group of future Spartans undergo a training program perfectly portraying that title, as they are pushed far past the limits of normal humans, and quickly pitted against the best squads the military has to offer in war games, during which the children are severely outnumbered and outgunned. In one such exercise, they (now teenagers) are separated in the frozen wilderness in an unpopulated region of the planet with no way to get home or contact each other. John finds each potential Spartan in turn and instructs them on how to survive the situation. Because of his leadership, everyone came back safely and without serious injury. For his performance, John was given the role of leader of the Spartans.<\\/p><p>After becoming fully developed, the young adult Spartans are brought aboard a space station orbiting Reach to undergo a risky procedure to enhance their physical strength, speed, and reflexes well beyond the limits of a human. Here is where the luck Dr. Halsey tested him for as a child would come in handy as less than half of the Spartans survived the procedure without becoming too damaged to continue on as an effective soldier. The newly formed super-soldier squad was sent on few missions before John was given the military rank of Master Chief Petty Officer. While travelling to receive their specially made (and ridiculously expensive) Mjolnir IV armor. Before the Spartans arrive at their destination, their ship serves as the vessel for humanity's first encounter with the Covenant. Pitted against weapons no one has ever seen before, the ship barely escapes intact. After being given their armor and an all too brief tutorial on how it works, the Spartans are pitted against the Covenant who had followed them there. This first encounter ended in victory, but with the loss of one of John's closest friend, who had stayed behind to destroy the ship after his suit was compromised.<\\/p><p>Over the next 20 years, Humanity's war with the covenant would ensue and in 2552, the Master Chief has a mission to capture and control a Covenant spaceship for research and analysis, with the aid of the Pillar of Autumn, commanded by Captain Keyes. However, the mission is soon interrupted when Reach is attacked by a Covenant armada. The Master Chief and the Spartans quickly go to aid the doomed planet. Unfortunately, the battle is deemed lost while Spartan 117 is battling the covenant aboard a space station. In order to survive, he is ordered to board the Pillar of Autumn, which, not even having enough time to calculate proper slipspace coordinates, jumps in order to escape as quickly as possible. As they make their escape, the survivors of Reach observe their former home being glassed by the <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/the-covenant\\/92-81\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Covenant<\\/a>, a procedure which uses Covenant ships to cook the surface of the planet from orbit, making it unlivable and literally turning the ground to glass. The Master Chief successfully escapes with the rest of the crew on the Pillar of Autumn, using the slipspace coordinates she acquired from a forerunner artifact discovered on Reach, but are unfortunately followed by a high ranking Covenant, command a fleet of ships.

The novel opens in 2552, with the Pillar of Autumn crew discovering Halo and seemingly a Covenant fleet waiting for them. The Covenant refuse to engage in ship to ship combat, for fear of damaging the sacred ring. The aliens then board the Pillar of Autumn. Meanwhile, the Master Chief is being awoken from cryostasis in order to aid in the defense of the Pillar of Autumn. Once awoken the Master Chief receives Cortana from Captain Keyes with orders to prevent her capture. The Master Chief escapes from the damned ship on an escape pod, crash landing on Halo.<\\/p><p>The novel then follows the Master Chief's endeavors, which can also be played in Halo: Combat Evolved. However the novel expands on the story with the character Major Antonio Silva and Melissa Mckay as they lead a group of ODST soldiers in combat against the Covenant. In a primary event of the game, Master Chief rescues Captain Keyes from the Covenant ship \\\"Truth and Reconciliation\\\". Keyes then reveals all the secrets of Halo he has overheard from conversations between the Covenant throughout his stay as their prisoner. While Master Chief is attempting to unearth the whereabouts of a lost squad, he comes across the helmet of Pvt. Wallace Jenkins. Using the video playback feature, the Master Chief uncovers the fate which befell the lost squad. This signals Spartan 117's first contact with the flood, a hive-minded parasite which reproduces by assimilating any living being it comes in contact with. Shortly afterword, 343 Guilty Spark (a.k.a. The Monitor) approaches the Master Chief and enlists him to help navigate the Library which contains the key needed to activate Halo, giving the Spartan the title of Reclaimer. Along the way, the Monitor implies that out of the 12 classes of armor available to the Forerunners, the Mjolnir V is equivalent to class 2.<\\/p><p>As the Chief is about to activate the ring using the key he obtained from the Library, an infuriated Cortana stops him in his tracks. Subsequently, the true nature of Halo is unveiled, the ring does not eliminate the Flood, but instead destroys their food supply, or in other words, all sentient life in the galaxy. The Master Chief is then forced to defend himself against the Sentinels, the Halo security drones under the command of the Monitor, and proceeds to attempt to destroy the Halo, and if they could, escape from it. The most efficient way to destroy the ring is to cause a massive explosion by overloading the fusion reactors aboard the Pillar of Autumn. To do so, the Chief would need to retrieve protocol codes possessed by Captain Keyes. In the midst of a rescue attempt, he discovers Keys had become one of the Covenant and Master Chief is forced to kill his commanding officer. While the Pillar of Autumn's fusion reactors explode, the Chief and Cortana locate an intact space-worthy fighter vessel, given the codename \\\"Longsword\\\", contained in one of the Hangars of the massive crashed ship. The novel ends with the Master Chief in a Longsword, floating in dead space, and awaiting rescue.<\\/p><p>Where the plot deviates from the game that shares its story is in the various scenarios not involving Spartan 117 including large scale battles between humans and Covenant, events which unfold after Master Chief leaves what would have been a level of the game. The most significant of these side-stories centers around a Covenant Grunt and Elite who frequently almost come in contact with Master Chief throughout the book before facing off with him near the end aboard the crashed Pillar of Autumn.<\\/p><h3>Halo: First Strike<\\/h3><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-size=\\\"small\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1064379\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/5911\\/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg\\\" data-ratio=\\\"1.6435406698565\\\" data-width=\\\"836\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" style=\\\"width: 836px\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:164.4%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/5911\\/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1064379\\\"><img alt=\\\"Halo: First Strike fills the gap between the first two Halo games\\\" src=\\\"data:image\\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\\\" data-width=\\\"389\\\" class=\\\"js-lazy-load-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/0\\/5911\\/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg\\\" data-srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/5911\\/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg 836w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/5911\\/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg 584w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/0\\/5911\\/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg 389w\\\"><noscript><img alt=\\\"Halo: First Strike fills the gap between the first two Halo games\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/0\\/5911\\/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/5911\\/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg 836w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/5911\\/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg 584w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/0\\/5911\\/1064379-halofirststrike.jpg 389w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\\\" data-width=\\\"389\\\"><\\/noscript><\\/a><figcaption>Halo: First Strike fills the gap between the first two Halo games<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p><u>Halo: First Strike<\\/u> by <i>Eric Nylund<\\/i> was written in 2003, transcribing the events that transpired between the first two Halo games. The novel starts right after the last scene in Halo: Combat Evolved with the Master Chief drifting off into space. Cortana soon finds a suspicious aircraft adrift in the wreckage remaining after the destruction of <a href=\\\"..\\/95-58\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Installation 04<\\/a>. On board, they discover <i>Corporal Locklear<\\/i>, <i>Sergeant Johnson<\\/i> and others. The <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/master-chief\\/94-175\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Master Chief<\\/a> initially suspects Johnson of being a flood form, since he saw him overcome on the Private Jenkins recording. It is later discovered that Sergeant Johnson's prolonged exposure to Plasma fire is his past has caused a unique immunity to the flood.<\\/p><p>The Master Chief and his newly acquired squad commandeer a Covenant ship called Ascendant Justice while it is patrolling through the wreckage. The humans then pilot the ship to get back to Reach; upon arrival the Master Chief recognizes a signal their ship intercepts saying \\\"<i>Oly Oly Oxen Free<\\/i>\\\", a signal which the Spartans used when they were in training on Reach. The Master Chief conjectures that there are surviving Spartans on the glassed planet. After landing, the Master Chief discovers several Spartans, Dr. Halsey and Vice Admiral Whitcomb; who ordered his own rescue during the battle for Reach. The reason for the Covenant not glassing this section of the planet perplexes everyone until it is revealed that the Covenant are seeking a Forerunner crystal. With the Covenant unwilling to damage the crystal in any way, the humans are able to avoid being fired upon for some time.<\\/p><p>Meanwhile, Cortana still aboard the Ascendant Justice has uncovered that the Covenant have acquired the location of Earth and are preparing for an invasion. The humans arm a Nova Thermonuclear mine, which is capable of destroying a planet and escape to the Ascendant Justice using the gravity lift. Before escaping, the Covenant seriously damage the Ascendant Justice leaving only one plasma cannon capable of firing. Master Chief recalls the location of a rebel base (which he invaded on his first mission) hidden in an asteroid. The humans enlist the aid of the rebels for repairs and the impending Covenant attack. Dr. Halsey instructs Locklear to prevent the Covenant from acquiring the Forerunner crystal, then abducts the unconscious Kelly - 087 on one of the rebel ships, leaving the others confused and betrayed by her actions. Locklear acts on his orders by using explosives, resulting in his death as well. Fortunately, the destruction of the crystal ends the ability of the Covenant to track the ships movement. While the fall of Earth is imminent, the Spartans determine that any time possibly acquired by delaying the Covenant was well worth the cost. The Spartans then launch a covert attack on the Covenant space-station, <i>Unyielding Hierophant<\\/i>, where the Covenant are amassing their ships for impending invasion*.<\\/p><p>The Spartans set the space-station to self-destruct and escape, although losing one Spartan to their first Brute encounter. Vice Admiral Whitcomb then realizes his most heroic effort in his lifetime, he single-handedly baits the entire Covenant fleet to surround the <i>Unyielding Hierophant<\\/i> at the time of the explosion, destroying almost all of the ships. While this effort would only hinder the Covenant effort, every hour bought for Earth's preparation would crucial for the defense of the last human sanctuary, Earth.<\\/p><p><i>* The fact that the Covenant know the location of Earth and are prepared for the invasion of Earth is implied in this novel. However, this contradicts Cortana's acquired information at the beginning of Halo 2, when she uncovers the fact that the Covenant were surprised to find humans or any resistance on Earth.<\\/i><\\/p><h3>Halo: Ghosts of Onyx<\\/h3><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-size=\\\"small\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1064370\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/5911\\/1064370-halo_cover.jpg\\\" data-ratio=\\\"1.4990892531876\\\" data-width=\\\"1647\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" style=\\\"width: 1647px\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:149.9%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/5911\\/1064370-halo_cover.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1064370\\\"><img alt=\\\"Halo: Ghosts of Onyx\\\" src=\\\"data:image\\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\\\" data-width=\\\"426\\\" class=\\\"js-lazy-load-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/0\\/5911\\/1064370-halo_cover.jpg\\\" data-srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/5911\\/1064370-halo_cover.jpg 1647w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/0\\/5911\\/1064370-halo_cover.jpg 1280w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/5911\\/1064370-halo_cover.jpg 640w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/0\\/5911\\/1064370-halo_cover.jpg 426w\\\"><noscript><img alt=\\\"Halo: Ghosts of Onyx\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/0\\/5911\\/1064370-halo_cover.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/5911\\/1064370-halo_cover.jpg 1647w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/0\\/5911\\/1064370-halo_cover.jpg 1280w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/5911\\/1064370-halo_cover.jpg 640w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_small\\/0\\/5911\\/1064370-halo_cover.jpg 426w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\\\" data-width=\\\"426\\\"><\\/noscript><\\/a><figcaption>Halo: Ghosts of Onyx<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p><ins>Halo: Ghosts of Onyx<\\/ins> (a.k.a.

Due to unforeseen aptitude on the part of the Covenant, there were only two Spartan - III survivors, Lucy-B092 and Tom-B292. It is later unveiled that the Colonel James Ackerson is mass producing these Spartan - III's with little regard to preserving their lives; selecting children with less than ideal genetic code in order to keep production quotas. The Colonel chooses Chief Mendez (the trainer of the original Spartan-II program) to head up training for the Spartan - III's with the aid of Kurt-051. Under the new name of Lieutenant Kurt Ambrose and a faked death courtesy of ONI, Kurt-051 is able to proceed with training the new Spartan-IIIs, unbeknownst to his fellow Spartan-II's.<\\/p><p>While the Spartan-III's are performing a training exercise on Onyx, some suspicious activity occurs in a forbidden sector.

From a very young age he exhibited some uncanny characteristics, for instance he was much larger than any other Child his age, smarter and more was in general much more developed than his peers. When John was six years old, 74 children were secretly kidnapped by the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) to participate in the Spartan-II project, which sought to create a new breed of cybernetic super soldier.<\\/p><p>The kidnapped children were \\\"flash cloned\\\" by the UNSC so that the parents of the children never even knew they were kidnapped.

Eight years later, all of the Spartan-II subjects underwent psychological, biological and cybernetic enhancements but only John and 32 others survived. These remaining Spartans donned their trademark <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/mjolnir-armor\\/93-33\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">MJOLNIR<\\/a> armor and entered into military service after completing the project and went on to face the deadly Halo antagonists the <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/the-covenant\\/92-81\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Covenant<\\/a>, the <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/the-flood\\/92-645\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Flood<\\/a> .

For all general purposes the Arbiter plays no significant role gameplay wise, he will assist on you on certain missions but that is the extent of his contribution and the Arbiter is a non playable character in the Halo 3. However, he is by default the leader of the Elites and the Covenant Separatists. He accompanies Master Chief to the Ark and for the Prophets betrayal he seeks to kill Truth. He accomplishes that along with the Master Chief's help and also helps in stopping Gravemind and the flood by setting off the ring over the Ark. He is last seen crashing on Earth, as his front part of the ship gets through the portal in one piece. He is present at the \\\"memorial\\\" on Earth and is seen leaving for the Elite home world of Sanghelios.<\\/p><h2>Antagonists<\\/h2><h3>The Covenant<\\/h3><p><a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/the-covenant\\/92-81\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">The Covenant<\\/a> is a collection of alien races ruled by the Prophets that have been waging a successful war against humanity. They include many species such as the Grunts, Jackals, Brutes, Hunters, Drones, Engineers (only in the Halo novels) and the ruling class, the Prophets. They also included the Elites, but they were cast out of the Covenant in 2552 in a bloody civil war that in turn forced the elites to ally with the humans. The races are all bound together by their unquestioned belief in the long extinct forerunners and their promise of the great journey. In that sense they follow the prophets who claim that they can lead them to this promise land. The leader of the Covenant was the Prophet of truth until he was executed by the Arbiter in the events in Halo 3. With the majority of their fleets decimated and facing both political and cultural upheaval, Jul' Mdama leads the Covenant Remnant after the war, thus beginning a Second Human-Covenant War.<\\/p><p><u><b>Prophets<\\/b><\\/u><\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-413284\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/5150\\/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\" data-width=\\\"1024\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" style=\\\"width: 1024px\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/5150\\/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-413284\\\"><img alt=\\\"Prophet of Truth\\\" src=\\\"data:image\\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\" class=\\\"js-lazy-load-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/5150\\/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg\\\" data-srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/5150\\/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg 1024w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/0\\/5150\\/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/5150\\/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg 480w\\\"><noscript><img alt=\\\"Prophet of Truth\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/5150\\/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/5150\\/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg 1024w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/0\\/5150\\/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/5150\\/413284-prophet_of_truth.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/noscript><\\/a><figcaption>Prophet of Truth<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><ul><li><u>Truth<\\/u> was the highest of the three ruling Covenant Prophets.

Annoyed by the lack of respect shown his race, and always being overshadowed by the Elites, he partners with the Prophets to overthrow the Elites. After the Prophet of Regret is killed by the Master Chief, Tartarus uses this as a chance to wrest control from the Elites, securing Honor Guard positions for his Brutes, and throwing the Elites out, although they are still members of the <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/the-covenant\\/92-81\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Covenant<\\/a>.

Part of him is from a human named Chakas. He is the monitor, historian, and caretaker of Installation 04, also simply known as Halo. His job was to protect the Halo ring, as well as assist a Reclaimer in the event of a Flood outbreak. Guilty Spark is first encountered at the end of the level \\\"343 Guilty Spark\\\" in Halo: CE, where he finds the Master Chief battling Flood in the bog outside Halo's Library. Believing the Chief to be a \\\"Reclaimer\\\", the Monitor transports him inside the Library. From this point forward, Guilty Spark remains certain that Master Chief is a Reclaimer, and so should already know all there is to know about the Flood and Forerunners. He expresses considerable surprise whenever the Chief deviates from the Forerunner's established Flood-control protocol. It's never actually explained why Guilty Spark believes the Chief to be a Reclaimer. However, it is speculated that because Humans apparently descended from the Foreunners, and because Master Chief is always encased inside his armor, Guilty Spark may have mistaken Master Chief for a Forerunner. At the end of Halo 3, it is the Master Chief that partially destroys Guilty Spark, after Spark turned on him to try and protect his newly constructed Halo. When he retreated in 2557, he was contacted by ONI and told them about the Forerunners' history and the Ur-Didact.<\\/li><\\/ul><h2>Important Locations<\\/h2><h3>Halo<\\/h3><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-size=\\\"small\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-10661\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/25\\/10661-290px-Installation_05.jpg\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.75172413793103\\\" data-width=\\\"290\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" style=\\\"width: 290px\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:75.2%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/25\\/10661-290px-Installation_05.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-10661\\\"><img alt=\\\"Halo firing\\\" src=\\\"data:image\\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\\\" data-width=\\\"290\\\" class=\\\"js-lazy-load-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/25\\/10661-290px-Installation_05.jpg\\\" data-srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/25\\/10661-290px-Installation_05.jpg 290w\\\"><noscript><img alt=\\\"Halo firing\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/25\\/10661-290px-Installation_05.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/25\\/10661-290px-Installation_05.jpg 290w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\\\" data-width=\\\"290\\\"><\\/noscript><\\/a><figcaption>Halo firing<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>The <a href=\\\"..\\/95-58\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Halo<\\/a> array is the last line of defense of an ancient race, known as the <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/the-forerunners\\/92-80\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Forerunners<\\/a>, and was built about 100,000 years before the first Halo game takes place. The Forerunners stumbled onto the Flood, an aggressively violent alien race that could bind itself to sentient life and thus spread rapidly. The Forerunners battled the Flood as best they could but were unable to defeat them, so to save the rest of the galaxy from being overtaken, Faber (Master Builder) constructed numerous Halo arrays. The Halos were built to research and contain the Flood, but if the beasts became too numerous, the Halos could all be activated and used to kill off all sentient life in the galaxy, depriving the Flood of food and thus eradicating them. The Halo array was activated once by the Forerunner known as IsoDidact.<\\/p><p>The Halo rings are one of a kind in the sense that they are technological marvels that cannot be equaled, not even by the Covenant. For all purposes they are small planets and have on them a wide variety or environments, ranging from Deserts to luscious rain forests. They also have some local wildlife and are \\\"staffed\\\" by sentinels and each of the 7 rings has a monitor attached to it. It is the monitors duty to maintain the ring and keep it in good working condition, so that if the need arises it could be fired with no hiccups.<\\/p><p>Since the true purpose of the ring is a gory one, Faber constructed it in a way that made sure that those who wished to activate it knew of the consequences. As such, every Halo ring had a central control room from which the ring could be fired, however to do so would require that he or she acquire the index, which was placed in the Library. Also, the Forerunners decided to place the monumental and suicidal task of activating the rings, not on the installation's monitors or the sentinels but rather on the \\\"reclaimers\\\"<\\/p><p>It also seems that the Halos were a place to study the flood and probably try to research some kind of drug to neutralize them. That would explain the large number of Flood specimens that were found in the Halos. While the seven Halo's were scattered throughout the galaxy, there was a central structure, the <a href=\\\"..\\/..\\/the-ark\\/95-125\\/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Ark<\\/a> that could be used to activate them all at the same time.

Marty O'Donnell has said that the <i>e minor<\\/i> chord holds the heart of the halo score. In Halo 1 many of the themes where established, but simple and airy. Halo 2 strengthened the themes and added many more orchestral layers to the mix. Halo 3 has a darker twist on those same themes adding baritone vocalists and an emphases on drums that created a more war like sound. In ODST the game abandons the previous halo themes almost completely, there is no choral music.<\\/p><p>The Music is a quieter more jazz-influenced sound. O'Donnell said that since the game tells \\\"a human story, not a cyborg story (The score should be) \\\"more intimate and personal. Two of the game's three hours of music are packaged in a two disc soundtrack and were released September 22.<\\/p><p>Most of the music for ODST and Halo 3 was recorded in Washington state and performed by The Northwest Sinfonia. Orchestra sessions were led by Stan LePard and performed by the Northwest Sinfonia, at studio X.<\\/p><p>The score for <a href=\\\"\\/halo-4\\/3030-35533\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-35533\\\">Halo 4<\\/a> was created by Neil Davidge, member of music group Massive Attack.<\\/p><p>The entirely of the <a href=\\\"\\/halo-5-guardians\\/3030-42905\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-42905\\\">Halo 5: Guardians<\\/a> was scored by <a href=\\\"\\/kazuma-jinnouchi\\/3040-112012\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3040-112012\\\">Kazuma Jinnouchi<\\/a>, as well as featuring a number of tracks from throughout the Halo franchise.<\\/p>\",\"id\":2,\"image\":{\"icon_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/image\\/square_avatar\\/410481-halo_small.jpg\",\"medium_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/image\\/scale_medium\\/410481-halo_small.jpg\",\"screen_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/image\\/screen_medium\\/410481-halo_small.jpg\",\"screen_large_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/image\\/screen_kubrick\\/410481-halo_small.jpg\",\"small_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/image\\/scale_small\\/410481-halo_small.jpg\",\"super_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/image\\/scale_large\\/410481-halo_small.jpg\",\"thumb_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/image\\/scale_avatar\\/410481-halo_small.jpg\",\"tiny_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/image\\/square_mini\\/410481-halo_small.jpg\"},\"name\":\"Halo\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/halo\\/3025-2\\/\"}],\"version\":\"1.0\"}",
