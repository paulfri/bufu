All of them focus on scoring you based on how well you can emulate the pitch and cadence of the original song. But actual karaoke, actually getting up and singing songs has very little to do with how well you can sing like the dude from Creed or whatever. It's about embarrassment. It's about self-deprecation. It's about making a song your own. It's about public drunkenness. It's about jumping out of your seat like a lunatic and rushing to whatever passes for a stage because your friend just got up to sing <span class=\\\"Apple-style-span\\\" style=\\\"font-style:italic; \\\">Build Me Up Buttercup<\\/span>. Back on the PlayStation 2, Sony's SingStar series was popular, but it only provided the basic ability to judge your singing. But on the PlayStation 3, it provides something that more closely resembles what karaoke is all about.<\\/div><div><br\\/><\\/div><div><figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/12081-singstar_09.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-12081\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/12081-singstar_09.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-12081\\\"><img alt=\\\"It's Nastytime!\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/26\\/12081-singstar_09.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/12081-singstar_09.jpg 800w, https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/26\\/12081-singstar_09.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>It's Nastytime!<\\/figcaption><\\/figure>Of course, the basic concept of SingStar hasn't really changed. The game provides players with songs to sing, and an on-screen display shows you the pitches you should be hitting and the words you should sing. The closer you get to this, the higher your score. You can sing by yourself or with another player. At the end of a song, your score is saved to a local leaderboard.<\\/div><div><br\\/><\\/div><div>Sounds pretty normal, to the point of being boring. That's why it's a good thing that SingStar on the PlayStation 3 makes use of the PlayStation Eye camera and the console's online abilities to create a community of people, around the world, singing songs and uploading 30-second clips of the performances to a central server. In the game's online area, you can create and edit your profile and dig through the profiles of others and watch them sing. That sounds pretty standard and not all that exciting, and I was pretty skeptical about the whole thing at first, but once you dive in and start watching what people are uploading, it's easy to get absolutely hooked.<\\/div><div><br\\/><\\/div><div>The My SingStar Online section quickly turns into one of those revelatory moments where technology makes the world seem just a little smaller. This becomes especially noticeable when you start looking at the list of latest uploads, which is full of people from around the world, and they're doing more than just singing. The best videos are brief performance pieces, from the trio of guys who re-enact a piece of a Supergrass video, to the guy in the UK who dons a Chewbacca costume and dances around to the Scissor Sisters, to the two girls who sing innocently while their boyfriends sneak up from behind and dump water on their heads, to the American kid singing Natalie Imbruglia while dressed up like a Ghostbuster, these videos feel like a window into living rooms from around the world.<\\/div><div><br\\/><\\/div><div>The videos are automatically created whenever you play. Each song has a specific 30-second section that's recorded, and an on-screen icon lets you know when the camera is rolling. At the end of each performance, you can go through and watch your clip, listen to the audio portion of your performance, and look at ten snapshots that are taken over the course of the song. You can opt to save any of those to your hard drive. From the saved media area, you can choose to upload your clips for the rest of the world to see. Content can be rated on a five-star scale, and it's easy to check how many views and the rating of your stuff from your online profile page. With all of this going on, the game's scoring system seems irrelevant--the judgment of your peers feels way more interesting and, unlike that dopey computer, other humans can judge you on style.<\\/div><div><br\\/><\\/div><div><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/12078-singstar_06.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-12078\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0\\\"><a  href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/12078-singstar_06.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-12078\\\"><img alt=\\\"Watch out for this idiot.\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/12078-singstar_06.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/12078-singstar_06.jpg w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>Watch out for this idiot.<\\/figcaption><\\/figure>The constant with all music games is that they live and die by the quality and quantity of their song list. Previous SingStar games have been broken up by genre, letting the country fans sing country in peace without having to deal with any rock or rap. The PS3 version of SingStar attempts to throw multiple genres together, which means you probably won't like every single song in the game. There are 30 songs on the disc from artists like Amy Winehouse, Beck, David Bowie, OutKast, Pixies, The Cardigans, Warrant, and Weezer. But you can also get online and buy additional songs for $1.49 each. The downloads are usually around 60MB each, and you get the song, as well as a version of the music video that has been cut up a bit to work on a 16:9 screen. The game launched with 200 songs already available.<\\/div><div><br\\/><\\/div><div>There are a couple warnings to consider when purchasing SingStar and buying songs out of the online store. For starters, your online purchases are locked to the PS3 that downloads them. So if you want to bring songs to a friend's house, be prepared to pack up your PS3. Also, the game only works with Sony's SingStar microphones. If you have a Rock Band mic or any other USB microphone, you're still out of luck. If you have SingStar mics from any of the PS2 releases, however, you're set. If not, the game is offered in two pacakges, one with mics and one without.<\\/div><div><br\\/><\\/div><div>Now, some of you are undoubtedly super-shy and would never dream of letting the world see you, in your bedroom, singing. That's fine. But if you're a little more extroverted and want a sanctioned location to look like a jackass, or if creatively creating 30-second videos to the delight or disgust of an online audience is up your alley, SingStar is kind of amazing. Just don't rock a Kangol hat and a wrestling belt when you sing--that's my thing.<\\/div><\\/div>\",\"dlc\":null,\"dlc_name\":null,\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-20462\\/\",\"id\":20462,\"name\":\"SingStar\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/singstar\\/3030-20462\\/\"},\"publish_date\":\"2008-05-23 13:00:00\",\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-72372\\/\",\"id\":72372,\"name\":\"SingStar\"},\"reviewer\":\"Jeff\",\"score\":4,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/reviews\\/singstar-review\\/1900-1\\/\",\"platforms\":\"PlayStation 3\"},{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/review\\/1900-2\\/\",\"deck\":\"Haze ticks most of the boxes on the \\\"things a first-person shooter should have\\\" form, but doesn't do so in a particularly interesting way.\",\"description\":\"<p>Haze attempts to deal with the concept of wartime propaganda and how troop morale is the most important thing an army can have.

Carpenter is a sergeant in the employ of the Mantel Corporation, some sort of futuristic government-like entity. You, with the rest of the Mantel forces, are in a South American region to fight against a dictator that your side has nicknamed Skin Coat because of his apparent proclivities for skinning and eating people. So you\\u2019re saving lives, right? The rest of your troop seems to think so. Right away, you\\u2019re introduced to a Mantel squad, a group of meat-headed soldiers who flip between talking about the great thing they\\u2019re doing for the people of this country, giving each other high fives, and generally bro\\u2019ing out.<\\/p><p>Now, that\\u2019s not that different than the sort of macho stereotypes you\\u2019ve come to expect from these sorts of in-game situations. The difference is that these guys are jacked up on future drugs! The drug of choice for the Mantel guys is called Nectar, and when you\\u2019re on it, you can move faster, shoot straighter, and generally avoid thinking about the horrors of war. It\\u2019s built into the suits of the troopers and fed out at a constant rate by their leaders. The game quickly lets you know that the Mantel forces are all, essentially, a bunch of junkies\\u2013even if the game\\u2019s often-inaccurate subtitles claim that the characters are really calling each other \\u201cjacknecks\\u201d instead of \\u201cjunkies.\\u201d Either way, right off the bat you get the impression that you\\u2019re on the wrong side of the conflict, and just like the back of the box and every single piece of pre-release hype that Ubisoft has produced says, you switch sides pretty quickly.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/4\\/10938-haze-04.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-10938\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0\\\"><a  href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/4\\/10938-haze-04.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-10938\\\"><img alt=\\\"These Mantel troopers are way into \\\"the grass.\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/4\\/10938-haze-04.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/4\\/10938-haze-04.jpg w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>These Mantel troopers are way into \\\"the grass.\\\"<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>When you finally enter combat after a lengthy intro, you\\u2019re thrown into a mostly-competent first-person shooter without a lot of weapon variety and few special features specific to which faction you\\u2019re currently fighting for. As a Mantel trooper, you get the ability to juice yourself up with Nectar. When you do, all the enemies start to glow, making them a little easier to pick out. You recover health more quickly, move a bit faster, and while the game claims you\\u2019ll be more accurate with your shots, I wasn\\u2019t really having any trouble in that department to begin with. The danger is that if you hold down the drug button too long, you\\u2019ll overdose and your gun will start to shoot all by itself and you\\u2019ll generally freak out for a few seconds.<\\/p><p>By comparison, the rebel fighters of the Promise Hand don\\u2019t use Nectar, but they have an ability that exploits the weaknesses of the drug. Apparently Nectar is designed to prevent users from seeing the horrors of war\\u2026 like dead bodies. So the main skill you have is playing dead, which you can do whenever you take any damage with no penalty as to how often you can use it. This sort of makes you invincible, provided you play dead long enough for the enemy to spread out. You can also dive by double-tapping jump, but this never seemed useful. You can also steal weapons from enemies, but aside from the one time that the game forces you to do it and sets everything up perfectly for you to do so, there\\u2019s no need to do that. There\\u2019s plenty of ammo around.<\\/p><p>Ammo\\u2019s rarely an issue because there are only a few different types of guns out there. You start out with an assault rifle and you occasionally encounter enemies wielding flamethrowers, shotguns, or rockets. But, if I had to make some kind of ballpark estimate, I\\u2019d say 90 percent of the enemies you fight have a standard assault rifle. Five percent have a shotgun, and the remaining five gives you the occasional flamethrower or other weapon. So the assault rifle you start with is the same assault rifle you\\u2019ll probably use at the game\\u2019s anti-climactic final confrontation. It took me around five hours to play through from start to finish on the game\\u2019s default difficulty. On the higher settings, you take more damage from enemy shots and seem to deal a little less damage with your own.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/4\\/10939-haze-03.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-10939\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0\\\"><a  href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/4\\/10939-haze-03.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-10939\\\"><img alt=\\\"Third tired drug reference goes right about here!\\\" src=\\\"data:image\\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\\\" class=\\\"js-lazy-load-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/4\\/10939-haze-03.jpg\\\" data-srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/4\\/10939-haze-03.jpg w\\\"><noscript><img alt=\\\"Third tired drug reference goes right about here!\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/4\\/10939-haze-03.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/4\\/10939-haze-03.jpg w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\\\"><\\/noscript><\\/a><figcaption>Third tired drug reference goes right about here!<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>In addition to playing alone, you can play the campaign in co-op mode with up to three additional players online. The game doesn\\u2019t adjust any of the cutscenes when you play this way, so everyone is Shane Carpenter. This makes the whole mode feel thrown together, as do the occasional bugs, like seeing other players seemingly hovering in mid-air. There\\u2019s also a more traditional 16-player multiplayer mode, but with three basic modes (deathmatch, team deathmatch, and assault) and six maps (with small and large configurations), there\\u2019s not much to see here. The multiplayer plays off of the strengths and weaknesses of the two sides, so rebels can play dead and confound Mantel troops, which seems way more powerful than the minimal bonuses that Nectar confers.<\\/p><p>Visually, parts of Haze look good. The game does jungle pretty well, though you won\\u2019t be ripping apart the foliage with gunfire and grenades or anything like that. Once you get into town or other areas, the game sports some textures that look pretty ugly up close. The audio is filled with speech from the other troops on the field, though they all repeat themselves very frequently, which makes it a very grating experience. For what it\\u2019s worth, I don\\u2019t think I heard the Korn song that seems to be getting more press than the game it\\u2019s based on once. I was surprised that it didn\\u2019t play over the end credits. Instead, the game has a collection of typical action game music during the campaign. In multiplayer, the game likes to loop a bunch of embarrassingly-rote hip-hop over the menus, the gameplay, everything. Hearing one song over and over for 20 minutes just seems like a bug, straight-up.<\\/p><p>Playing Haze left me disappointed, for sure, but it also left me extremely curious about its development. Free Radical, the developers of Haze, have done better in the past in almost every single way possible, from weapons, to levels, to bot intelligence. Though it was announced just over two years ago, the end result plays like something that was slapped together and shipped after a year or so, rather than something that was painstakingly developed and refined. While there\\u2019s nothing about Haze that\\u2019s out-and-out broken or completely terrible, it doesn\\u2019t come close to meeting the expectations that today\\u2019s first-person shooter market creates.<\\/p>\",\"dlc\":null,\"dlc_name\":null,\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-20455\\/\",\"id\":20455,\"name\":\"Haze\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/haze\\/3030-20455\\/\"},\"publish_date\":\"2008-05-20 17:00:00\",\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-72358\\/\",\"id\":72358,\"name\":\"Haze\"},\"reviewer\":\"Jeff\",\"score\":2,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/reviews\\/haze-review\\/1900-2\\/\",\"platforms\":\"PlayStation 3\"}],\"version\":\"1.0\"}",
